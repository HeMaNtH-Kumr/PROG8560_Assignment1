      <h3>Vegetables</h3>
      <p>
        Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
        animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
        applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
        including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A vegetable is the edible portion of a plant. Vegetables are usually
        grouped according to the portion of the plant that is eaten such as
        leaves (lettuce), stem (celery), roots (carrot), tubers (potato), bulbs
        (onion) and flowers (broccoli). A fruit is the mature ovary of a plant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vegetables are the leaves, stems, roots, or other parts of certain
        plants that people eat. Vegetables usually come from herbaceous plants.
        Herbaceous plants have stems that are softer than the woody stems of
        bushes and trees. Many vegetables grow aboveground.

      <h3>Fruits</h3>
      <p>
        A fruit is a mature, ripened ovary, along with the contents of the
        ovary. The ovary is the ovule-bearing reproductive structure in the
        plant flower. The ovary serves to enclose and protect the ovules, from
        the youngest stages of flower development until the ovules become
        fertilized and turn into seeds
      </p>
      <p>
        Fruits are classified according to the arrangement from which they
        derive. There are four typesâ€”simple, aggregate, multiple, and accessory
        fruits. Simple fruits develop from a single ovary of a single flower and
        may be fleshy or dry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word fruit matured in Middle English and grew from the seeds of
        Anglo-French frut and fruit, which are rooted in the Latin verb frui,
        meaning "to enjoy" or "to have the use of." Scientifically, it is the
        name for the fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant enclosing
        a seed or seeds.
